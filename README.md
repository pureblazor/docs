# PureBlazor CMS

PureBlazor is a .NET, cloud-native, AI-first CMS for modern apps, built with and for Blazor. PureBlazor is for those who love and want to use C# as their single programming language to build anything. 

Our project will live or die by listening to the .NET community. That's why we're building in public and [opening our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/pureblazor/projects/1) for your feedback.

The PureBlazor CMS will be available for self hosting or cloud hosting. [Sign up for the waitlist](https://pureblazor.com/) to get early access.

## PureBlazor Components
As we're building, we'll be publishing [PureBlazor Components](https://github.com/pureblazor/components) for you to use, free and open source.
